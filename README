A paint program for arduino.

Controls:
  Use D-pad to move cursor.
  Press B to paint with current brush.
  Hold A and press right/left to change brush size.
  Hold A and press up/down to change brush.

The design makes it easy to add and change brushes, but the program has not been optimized for memory, so adding much more currently causes instability.
